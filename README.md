## Introduction

- In this **Wify Assignment** we have created a dynamic form rendering application built using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. The form is generated based on a JSON schema and includes proper validation based on input types.

It is designed as part of a developer assessment where the form updates automatically if the JSON is changed.
